This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the required npm packages by running:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

After the installation is complete, make sure to create your own `env.local` file based on the `env.local.example` file provided. This file is used to store environment variables, including your API key. Please replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key in the `env.local` file.

Once you have your `env.local` file set up, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.
